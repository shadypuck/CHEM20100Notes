    \item \marginnote{2/4:}Ammonia undergoes a facile inversion ("umbrella flip") as shown below. The activation barrier for inversion is low ($\Delta G^\ddagger\sim\SI{5}{kcal\per\mole}$), and the transition state for this motion is planar \ce{NH3}. Note that the relevant valence shell IP's are $\ce{N}_{2s}=\SI{-26.0}{eV}$, $\ce{N}_{2p}=\SI{-13.4}{eV}$, and $\ce{H}_{1s}=\SI{-13.6}{eV}$.

        \begin{proof}[Answer]
            Point group: $D_{3h}$\par
            Basis functions: all three \ce{H} orbitals, \ce{N_{$2s$}}, \ce{N_{$2p_x$}}, \ce{N_{$2p_y$}}, and \ce{N_{$2p_z$}}.\par
            Apply operations, generate reducible representations, and reduce to irreducible representations (for orbitals of the center atom, read irreducible representations from the $D_{3h}$ character table):
            \begin{align*}
                \Gamma_{\ce{H}} &= (3,0,1,3,0,1) = A_1'+E'\\
                \Gamma_{\ce{N_{$2s$}}} &= A_1'\\

        \item Label the MOs with the appropriate Mulliken symbols ($a_{1g}$, $e_g$, etc.) and add electrons to show the proper orbital occupancies.
        \begin{proof}[Answer]
            See Figure \ref{fig:orbitalDiagram-NH3-planar}.
        \end{proof}
        \item Compare your MO diagram with that for pyramidal \ce{NH3} (Figure 5.30 in your text), and comment qualitatively on why this process is a low-energy one.
        \begin{proof}[Answer]
            It appears that the only change between the two MO diagrams is that the two $3a_1$ electrons in the pyramidal \ce{NH3} diagram must be excited to the $1a_2''$ orbital in the planar \ce{NH3} diagram. Since $1a_2''$ is higher in energy than $3a_1$, there will be an increase in energy, but since it is only marginally higher, the increase will be very small.

                \caption{The $\boxed{A_1}$ bending mode.}
                \label{fig:NH3bend}
            \end{figure}
            If any vibrational mode is responsible for the inversion, it certainly won't be a stretching mode since these have no effect on molecular geometry about the central atom. On the other hand, a bending mode could well achieve such a transition. Thus, we will find the bending modes in both pyramidal and planar \ce{NH3} and compare.\par\medskip
            For pyramidal \ce{NH3}, the $C_{3v}$ character table tells us that $\Gamma_{x,y,z}=(3,0,1)$. We can also figure out that the number of atoms unmoved after applying each symmetry operation is $(4,1,2)$. Thus, $\Gamma_{3N}=(12,0,2)$. We can decompose this by inspection to $\Gamma_{3N}=3A_1+A_2+4E$. Since $\Gamma_\text{trans}=A_1+E$ and $\Gamma_\text{rot}=A_2+E$ (again from the $C_{3v}$ character table), we have by subtraction that $\Gamma_\text{vibs}=2A_1+2E$.\par
            We can determine that $\Gamma_\nu=(3,0,1)$ by counting how many $\overrightarrow{\ce{N-H}}$ vectors stay the same under each symmetry operation. We can decompose this by inspection to $\Gamma_\nu=A_1+E$. Thus, we have by subtraction that $\Gamma_\delta=A_1+E$.\par\smallskip
            For planar \ce{NH3}, the $D_{3h}$ character table tells us that $\Gamma_{x,y,z}=(3,0,-1,1,-2,1)$. We can also figure out that the number of atoms unmoved after applying each symmetry operation is $(4,1,2,4,1,2)$. Thus, $\Gamma_{3N}=(12,0,-2,4,-2,2)$. We can decompose this by repeated applications of the reduction formula to $\Gamma_{3N}=A_1'+A_2'+3E'+2A_2''+E''$. Since $\Gamma_\text{trans}=E'+A_2''$ and $\Gamma_\text{rot}=A_2'+E''$ (again by the $D_{3h}$ character table), we have by subtraction that $\Gamma_\text{vibs}=A_1'+2E'+A_2''$.\par
            We can determine that $\Gamma_\nu=(3,0,1,3,0,1)$ by counting how many $\overrightarrow{\ce{N-H}}$ vectors stay the same under each symmetry operation. We can decompose this by inspection to $\Gamma_\nu=A_1'+E'$. Thus, we have by subtraction that $\Gamma_\delta=E'+A_2''$.\par\medskip
            Since the $E$ pyramidal bending modes transform into the analogous $E'$ planar bending modes, but the $A_1$ pyramidal bending mode has no planar analogue, it is the $A_1$ bending mode in pyramidal \ce{NH3} that causes the inversion. This derivation can be rationalized intuitively by noting that the movement that causes the inversion must look like the totally symmetric bending mode in Figure \ref{fig:NH3bend}.

    \item ${\color{white}x}$
    \begin{enumerate}[label={\alph*)}]
        \item Use group theory to construct an MO diagram for octahedral \ce{SF6}. Consider only $\sigma$-bonding between \ce{S} and the \ce{F}'s and use only the sulfur $3s$ and $3p$ valence orbitals (i.e., ignore the $3d$-orbital involvement). For fluorine, just use a "$\sigma$-type" orbital to determine the $6\times\ce{F}$ group orbitals.
        \begin{proof}[Answer]
            Point group: $O_h$\par
            Basis functions: all six \ce{F} orbitals, \ce{S_{$3s$}}, \ce{S_{$3p_x$}}, \ce{S_{$3p_y$}}, and \ce{S_{$3p_z$}}.\par
            Apply operations, generate reducible representations, and reduce to irreducible representations (for orbitals of the center atom, read irreducible representations from the $O_h$ character table):
            \begin{align*}
                \Gamma_{\ce{F}} &= (6,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,4,2) = A_{1g}+E_g+T_{1u}\\

        \item Based on the MO diagram, comment on the number of bonding electrons in \ce{SF6} and the bond-order of each \ce{S-F} bond.
        \begin{proof}[Answer]
            There are \fbox{8 bonding electrons} (the two in the $1a_{1g}$ orbital, and the six in the degenerate $1t_{1u}$ orbitals; the four in the degenerate $1e_g$ orbitals are nonbonding and all anti-bonding orbitals are unfilled). Since the bond order is one half the number of bonding electrons divided by the number of bonds, we have
            \begin{equation*}
                \boxed{\text{B.O.} = \frac{2}{3}}
