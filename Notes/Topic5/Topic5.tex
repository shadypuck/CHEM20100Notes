\chapter{Coordination Chemistry: Structures and Isomers of Metal Complexes}
\section{Module 28: Introduction to Coordination Compounds}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{2/12:}Modern inorganic chemistry is heavily concerned with the transition metals, i.e., the $d$-block elements.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most industrial catalysts utilize transition metal compounds.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Transition metals vs. main-group elements:
\end{itemize}
\begin{tchart}{1.4}{Transition-Metal Compounds}{Main-Group Elements}
    Multiple oxidation states (e.g., the 11 oxidation states of \ce{Mn} from $-3$ to $+7$) & Single oxidation state\\
    Brightly colored (thus a gap between HOMO and LUMO of a few electron volts) & Usually colorless\\
    Usually have partially occupied valence $d$-orbitals that are often relatively close in energy & The valence $s$- or $p$-orbitals are either fully occupied or empty and are far apart energetically\\
    Often paramagnetic & Usually diamagnetic\\
    Often interact with small molecules such as \ce{CO}, \ce{C2H4}, and \ce{H2} & Generally do not interact strongly with  \ce{CO}, \ce{C2H4}, or \ce{H2}
\end{tchart}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The orbital energy gap matches the bond energies of small molecules pretty well.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is exactly what is needed for activating those chemical bonds, i.e., making catalytic cycles!
    \end{itemize}
    \item History:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prussian blue ink is the first synthetic blue dye, and one of the first coordination compounds created (used in famous paintings such as \emph{Starry Night}).
        \item The structure of coordination complexes was not understood until 1907, however.
        \item Blomstrand and Jorgenson tried to determine the structure of \ce{Co(NH3)4Cl3}, but their guess didn't explain isomers.
        \item Alfred Werner (late 1800s) was the father of coordination chemistry.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item He noticed that excess \ce{AgNO3} could only liberate and precipitate as \ce{AgCl} one chlorine from both the green and violet isomers of \ce{CoCl3*(NH3)4}.
            \item However, it could precipitate two chlorines from \ce{CoCl3*(NH3)5} and three from \ce{CoCl3*(NH3)6}.
            \item This observation plus a number of controls led him to \textbf{Werner's Conclusions}.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Werner's Conclusions}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In this series of compounds, cobalt has a constant \textbf{coordination number} of 6.
        \item As the \ce{NH3} molecules are removed, they are replaced by \ce{Cl-}, which acts as if it is covalently bonded to cobalt.
        \item Chloride and ammonia are now called ligands.
        \item Ligands are a Lewis base/electron pair donors that can bind to a metal ion.
        \item A metal complex is a metal ion combined with ligands.
        \item Coordination complexes are neutral and counter ions are not bonded to the central metal ion but balance the charge.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For example, in $[\stackrel{+3}{\ce{Co}}\!(\stackrel{0}{\ce{NH3}})_6]\!\stackrel{-3}{\ce{Cl}}_3$, the three chloride ions are the counter ions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Coordination number}: The number of groups that can bond directly to the metal.
    \item Werner also hypothesized an octahedral geometry for all cobalt complexes.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If it were hexagonal planar or trigonal antiprismatic, there would be three isomers of the coordination sphere for the compound with two chlorines (think ortho, meta, para isomers for the hexagonal planar example).
        \item However, if it is octahedral, the compound with two chlorines will have two isomers (the chlorines can either be $\ang{180}$ to each other or $\ang{90}$ to each other).
        \item Octahedral also reduces steric crowding.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coodination compound}: A compound with a metal center, a coordination sphere, and counter ions. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{coordination complex}.
    \item Werner also resolved hexol into optically active isomers. This was the first optically active chiral \emph{inorganic} compound.
\end{itemize}



\section{Module 29: Types and Classes of Ligands}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monodentate ligand}: A ligand that binds to a metal ion through a single donor site. \emph{Etymology} one-toothed.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, \ce{NH3} is a monodentate ligand.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bridging ligand}: A ligand that binds to two or more metal ions simultaneously.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, \ce{O^2-} is a bridging ligand.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ambidentate ligand}: A ligand with two kinds of binding sites that can bind through one or the other but not both simultaneously.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, thiocyanide can bond through \ce{S} or \ce{N} but not both simultaneously.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multidentate chelating ligand}: A ligand bound to a metal through several donor sites. \emph{Etymology} multitooth crab claw (crabs grab their food with two claws in the same way a metal can be attracted to two lone pairs from different groups on the same ligand). \emph{Also known as} \textbf{polydentate chelating ligand}.
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \chemfig[atom sep=1cm]{[:54]M*5(-[,,,1,stealth-,grx,semithick]NH_2-[,,,1]CH_2-H_2C-[,,2,2]H_2N-[,,,,-stealth,grx,semithick])}
        \caption{An example of a bidentate chelating ligand.}
        \label{fig:bidentateLigand}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, ethylenediamine (\ce{H2NCH2CH2NH2}; see Figure \ref{fig:bidentateLigand}) can bond to the same metal with both of its nitrogens' lone pairs at the same time.
        \item Thus, ethylenediamine is is bidentate, and it forms a 5-membered chelate ring.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The chelate effect: For a given metal ion, the thermodynamic stability of a chelated complex involving bidentate or polydentate ligands is greater than that of a complex containing a corresponding number of comparable monodentate ligands.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that 5-membered rings are more stable than 6, and 4-membered rings (or smaller) are not stable due to angle strain.
        \item For example, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) is a hexadentate ligand has two nitrogens and four oxygens that wrap entirely around a metal atom and bond very strongly.
        \item $\beta$-diketones and acetylacetone are also polydentate ligands.
        \item Multidentate bonding is incredibly strong.
        \item As one last example, hemoglobin and chlorophyll have extra stability because the iron/magnesium ion is attached to four nitrogens.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Explanations of the chelate effect:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Effective concentration: If one bond breaks, the bridge between the two bonding sites in the ligands still holds the other site in close proximity to the metal, making it more likely that the bond will reform than if the metal and ligand were floating entirely independently.
        \item Entropy considerations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Imagine you have a coordination complex. If you substitute two monodentate ligands for two other monodentate ligands, you do not change the number of particles.
            \item However, if you substitute one polydentate chelating ligand for two monodentate ligands, you increase the number of particles by 1, increasing disorder in the universe and favoring the forward reaction.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Looking at the temperature-dependence of equilibrium, we can calculate $\Delta G^\circ$. We can then use this to calculate $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$, and we find that the contributions are very similar. Thus, both explanations of the chelate effect contribute about equally.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Covalent bond classification (CBC) method:
    \item \textbf{X-type} (ligand): A ligand that donates one electron to the metal and accepts one electron from the metal when using the neutral ligand method of electron counting, or donates two electrons to the metal when using the donor pair method of electron counting.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examples: hydrogen, the halogens, hydroxide, cyanide, carbocation, and nitric oxide.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L-type} (ligand): A neutral ligand that donates two electrons to the metal center regardless of the electron counting method being used.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examples: carbon monoxide, \ce{PR3}, ammonia, water, carbenes (\ce{=CRR}'), and alkenes.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Z-type} (ligand): A ligand that accepts two electrons from the metal center as opposed to the donation occurring with the other two types of ligands.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examples: Lewis acids, such as \ce{BR3}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item LXZ notation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Take the traditional formula and replace the central metal atom with \ce{M}, each X-type ligand with \ce{X}, each L-type ligand with \ce{L}, and each Z-type ligand with \ce{Z}. Then, if necessary, combine ligands of the same type using subscript arabic numerals, as per usual. Conserve the braces and charge.
        \item For example, \ce{[Ir(CO)(PPh3)2(Cl)(NO)]^2+} becomes \ce{[ML3X2]^2+}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Module 30: Nomenclature and Isomers of Metal Complexes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{2/15:}Midterm 1:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Average: 67.0.
        \item Standard deviation: 14.8.
        \item Max: 93.
        \item $80+$ scores: 10.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Midterm 2 will cover modules 13-31 (with concepts from modules 1-12).
    \item Suggested reading: \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr} Section 9.2.
    \item Naming metal complexes:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For complex ions, write the cation first and anion last.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For example, \ce{K2[PtCl4]} is potassium tetrachloroplatinate.
            \item Note that you do not use the prefix mono, di, tri, etc. here to indicate the number of cations.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Name the ligands first in alphabetical order, the metals last.
        \item Prefixes to indicate numbers (di, tri, tetra, \dots) for all monoatomic ligands, polyatomic ligands with short names and neutral ligands with special names.
        \item Prefixes bis-, tris-, tetrakis-, pentakis-, hexakis- for ligands whose names contain a prefix of the first type, neutral ligands without special names, and ionic ligands with particularly long names.
        \item If the anion is complex, add the suffix -ate to the name of the metal. If the symbol comes from Latin/Greek, then we go back to the Latin/Greek for the name of the anion.
        \item Put the oxidation state in Roman numerals in parentheses after the name of the central metal ion of the ligand.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Examples:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{[CoCl4]^2-} is the tetrachlorocobaltate (II) ion.
        \item \ce{[Fe(CN)6]^4-} is the hexacyanoferrate (II) ion.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notice the use of "ferr" for iron (this is going back to the Latin/Greek name of the central metal ion as in Step 5).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \ce{[Cr(H2O)4Cl2]+} is the tetraaquadicchlorochromium (III) ion.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item No use of -ate because this is a cation (not an anion).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \ce{[Cr(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3]^3+} is the tris(ethylenediammine)chromium (III) ion.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Note that ammine with two m's is correct --- an \textbf{amine} is a functional group from ammonia, while an \textbf{ammine} is a group of coordination compounds where ammonia is a ligand.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Neutral ligands have the same name as the molecule with 4 exceptions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{NH3} is ammine.
        \item \ce{H2O} is aqua.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aquo or aqua?
        \end{itemize}
        \item \ce{CO} is carbonyl.
        \item \ce{NO} is nitrosyl.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Anionic ligands require replacing -ide in the ionic name (if present) with -o. For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{Cl-} becomes chloro.
        \item \ce{OH-} becomes hydroxo.
        \item \ce{SO4^2-} is still sulfate?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bridging ligands:

        \caption{A coordination compound with bridging ligands.}
        \label{fig:muLigandNomenclature}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use $\mu$ to indicate a bridge.
        \item If there are more than one of a given bridging ligand, the prefix indicating the number of ligands is placed after the $\mu$.
        \item If there are more than one different bridging ligands, they are given in alphabetical order.
        \item For example, the compound in Figure \ref{fig:muLigandNomenclature} is the tetraaminecobaltate(III)-$\mu$-amido-$\mu$-peroxo-tetraaminecobaltate(III) ion.

    \item Table \ref{tab:irregularLigands} lists some more common but irregular or unfamiliar ligands.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that when listed in Table \ref{tab:irregularLigands}, ambidentate ligands bind through the atom listed most to the left in the formula.
        \item Note also that the slides list a number of common bidentate and polydentate ligands.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Suggested reading: \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr} Section 9.3.
    \item Coordination complex isomers are divided into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Structural isomers (different bonds).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Coordination isomerism.
            \item Linkage isomerism.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Stereoisomers (same bonds, different spatial arrangements).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Geometric isomerism (\emph{cis}-\emph{trans}).
            \item Optical isomerism.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ionization isomers}: Ligands inside the coordination sphere exchange places with ligands outside the coordination sphere.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item So named because these give different ions when dissolved in water.
        \item Werner's four isomers of \ce{CrCl3*6H2O} are ionization isomers.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linkage isomers}: Variations in at which site an ambidentate ligand bonds.
    \item \textbf{Geometric isomers}: Found in square planar and octahedral complexes --- \emph{cis}- vs. \emph{trans}-isomers.

\emph{From \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{3/8:}Coordination compounds are examples of acid-base adducts.
    \item Modern formulas write the coordination sphere in brackets.
    \item \textbf{Stock system}: A method for designating charge or oxidation number that uses the oxidation number of the metal.
    \item \textbf{Ewing-Bassett system}: A method for designating charge or oxidation number that uses the charge on the coordination sphere.
    \item An example of complicated bridging nomenclature:

        \label{fig:complicatedBridgingIon}
    \end{figure}
    \item When a complex is negatively charged, the names for these metals are derived from the source of their symbols:
    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \small
        \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
        \begin{tabular}{l|l}
            \textbf{Metal} & \textbf{Name}\\
            \hline
            iron (\ce{Fe}) & ferrate\\
            silver (\ce{Ag}) & argentate\\
            lead (\ce{Pb}) & plumbate\\
            tin (\ce{Sn}) & stannate\\
            gold (\ce{Au}) & aurate\\
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Latin/Greek anion names.}
        \label{fig:latinGreekAnions}
    \end{table}
    \item We will not discuss isomerism where the ligands themselves are isomers.
    \item Some large bidentate chelating ligands can span \emph{trans} positions; however, as ligand length increases, so does the probability of the ligand bonding to multiple metal centers in a bridging fashion instead of just one.
    \item Molecules that lack $S_n$ axes are chiral:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item "Because $S_1\equiv\sigma$ and $S_2\equiv i$, locating a mirror plane or inversion center in a structure indicates that it is not cchiral. A structure may be achiral by virtue of an $S_n$ axis where $n>2$ even without the presence of a mirror plane or inversion center as symmetry elements" \parencite[323]{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.
        \item Thus, chiral molecules either have no symmetry elements (are $C_1$) or have only axes of proper rotation (are $C_n$).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facial} (isomer of a \ce{ML3L$'$3} complex): An isomer with three identical ligands on one triangular face.
    \item \textbf{Meridional} (isomer of a \ce{ML3L$'$3} complex): An isomer with three identical ligands in a plane bisecting the molecule.
    \item Facial and meridional isomers are possible with monodentate and tridentate ligands.
    \item Linear tetradentate ligands (e.g., triethylenetetramine or trien):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Three forms: "$\alpha$, with all three chelate rings in different planes; $\beta$, with two of the rings coplanar; and \emph{trans}, with all three rings coplanar" \parencite[323-24]{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Common numbering of octahedral ligands: We have "positions 1 and 6 in axial positions and 2 through 5 in counterclockwise order as viewed from the 1 position" \parencite[325]{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.
    \item P\'{o}lya used group theory to calculate the number of certain types of isomers.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr} explores this at depth.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Left-handed} (propeller): One such that rotating it counterclockwise would move it away from the observer.
    \item \textbf{Right-handed} (propeller): One such that rotating it clockwise would move it away from the observer.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is why rotating right-handed (screws) tightens them (moves them away from the observer).
    \end{itemize}
    \item A molecule with more than one pair of rings may require more than one label: Determine the handedness of each pair of skew rings, and then include all the designations in the final description.
    \item Ligand ring conformation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ligand rings (such as en) can also have their own conformations.
        \item Construct a line between the two atoms bonded to the metal, and a second line connecting the other two atoms (in en).
        \item If, when viewed through the lines looking at the metal, the second line is rotated counterclockwise compared to the first, the ring is in the $\lambda$ conformation. Otherwise, it is in the $\delta$ conformation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Different conformations have varying stabilities.
    \item \textbf{Hydrate isomerism}: Water as a ligand vs. as an additional occupant (or solvate) within the crystal structure.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For example, \ce{[Cr(H2O)6]Cl3}, \ce{[CrCl(H2O)5]Cl2*H2O}, and \ce{[CrCl2(H2O)4]Cl*2H2O} are hydrate isomers.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solvent isomerism}: Hydrate isomerism with ammonia or other ligands.
    \item \textbf{Coordination isomerism}: With two or more metal centers, the ligand:metal ratio remains the same, but the ligands attached to a specific metal ion change.
    \item Covers methods of separating isomers.
    \item \textbf{Optical rotatory dispersion}: With respect to optically active isomers, the optical rotation, as caused by a difference in the refractive indices of the right and left ccircularly polarized light according to the equation
    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha = \frac{\eta_l-\eta_r}{\lambda}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\eta_l$ and $\eta_r$ are the refractive indices for left and right circularly polarized light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{ORD}.
    \item \textbf{Cotton effect}: The variance of plane-polarized light absorption with wavelength.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This quantity is positive when the rotation is positive (right-handed) at low energy, and negative when it is positive at high energy.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Circular dichroism}: A spectral phenomenon caused by the differencce in the absorption of right- and left-circularly polarized light, defined by the equation $\varepsilon_l-\varepsilon_r$ where $\varepsilon_l$ and $\varepsilon_r$ are the molar absorption coefficients for left- and right-circularly polarized light. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{CD}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Observied in the viscinity of an absorption band.
        \item CD is more selective than ORD.
    \end{itemize}
    \item When desccribing molecular geometries, we assume that the metal $d$ elecctrons are stereochemically inactive.
    \item The structure of a coordination compound is the result of four interdependent factors of shifting relative importance:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item VSEPR considerations.
        \item Occupancy of $d$ orbitals.
        \item Steric interference.
        \item Crystal packing effects.
        \begin{itemize}[label={\scriptsize$\blacksquare$}]
            \item Sizes of ions and shapes of coordination complexes when packed into a crystalline lattice.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item 1-coordinate complexes don't exist in solution; however, there are a few organometallic examples.
    \item There are some linear and a number of nonlinear 2-coordinate complexes.
    \item Low-coordinate compounds' \textbf{coordinative unsaturation} provides opportunities for small molecule \textbf{activation} and unique magnetic properties.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Small molecules are favored for activation because bulky ligands are used to stabilize low-coordinate structures, meaning that only a small molecule will be able to access the coordination center.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activation}: Enabling molecules to react which are otherwise unreactive under a set of conditions.
    \item 4-coordinate species:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tetrahedral and see-saw geometries are both fairly common.
        \item The Jahn-Teller effect may distort some tetra-coordinated complexes from tetrahedral gemoetry.
        \item Square-planar geometry is also farily common, especially with $d^8$ ions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 5-coordinate species:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trigonal-bipyramidal, square-pyramidal, and pentagonal-planar geometries (the latter being exceedingly rare) predominate.
        \item Molecules sometimes alternate rapidly between the former two due to their typiclly small energy difference.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 6-coordinate species:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The most common coordination number.
        \item Octahedral complexes predominate, but trigonal prismatic structures are also known.
        \item Trigonal prismatic structures exist in eclipsed, staggered, and in between conformations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 7-coordinate species:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pentagonal-bipyramidal, capped trigonal prism, and capped octahedron geometries are possible.
        \item "In the capped shapes, the seventh ligand is simply added to a face of the core structure, with necessary adjustments to the other angles to accommodate the additional ligand" \parencite[343]{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.
        \item Preference for one structure over another is driven by the ligands.
    \end{itemize}
    \item 8-coordinate species:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Square antiprismatic and dodecahedral geometries.
        \item Less common with first-row transition metals because a relatively larger atomi/ionicc radius better accomodates the many ligands.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Coordination numbers are known up to 16.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 9-coordinate lanthanides and actinides are not uncommon.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry: A triangular prism with a cap through each rectangular face.
            \item Capped square antiprismatic.
        \end{itemize}
        \item One newly synthesized compound appears to have a 12-coordinate $sd^5$-hybridized \ce{Mo} center, and a cluster with \ce{Zn-Zn} bonding.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coordination polymer}: A solid  in which coordination ccomplexes are linked through ligands in "infinite" arrays.
    \item \textbf{Metal-organic framework}: A three-dimensional extended structure in which metal ions or clusters are linked through organic molecules that have two or more sites through which links can be formed. \emph{Also known as} \textbf{MOF}.
    \item There is a detailed classification system for networks by three-letter codes, e.g., bcu for body-centered cubic.
    \item \textbf{Metalloligand}: A coordination complex with an attached donor group on its ligand.
\end{itemize}
