\chapter{Review of VSEPR Theory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{1/11:}Homework questions will be similar to exam questions, so although you probably \emph{can} find answers online, you shouldn't.
    \item Submit Psets to \href{mailto:chem201hw@gmail.com}{chem201hw@gmail.com}.
    \item Watch modules before office hours and bring questions.
    \item If you have a question outside of office hours, post it on Slack.
    \item It's a difficult class, but he is open to and welcomes our feedback (via Slack, again).
    \item You do need to read from \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}, too; his class is not a replacement for this textbook.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He is a big fan of \textcite{bib:Cotton}.
        \item There is an extra, new textbook to look for!
    \end{itemize}
    \item Convince yourself not to be afraid of time-independent quantum mechanics (we won't go too deep, but know wave functions and the like).
    \item Exams will probably be open book/open note.
    \item Inorganic chemistry contains too much information to rationalize empirically, so we need a system (the development of this system will be the focus of this course).
    \item Reviews history of chemistry from \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr} Chapter 1.
    \item What is Nickel's electron configuration?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item When Nickel is a free atom, the $[\text{Ar}]4s^23d^8$ electron configuration is the lowest energy.
        \item When Nickel is chemically bound, the $[\text{Ar}]3d^{10}$ electron configuration is the lowest energy because it is energetically unfavorable to have a large 4s orbital pushing the bounds of the atom.
        \item What is a \textbf{term symbol}?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Homework: Refresh Chapter 2 in \textcite{bib:MiesslerFischerTarr}.
    \item \textbf{Covalent bond}: The sharing of pairs of electrons\dots?
    \item G. N. Lewis predicts in 1916 (before Rutherford) that the atom has a positive \textbf{kernel} surrounded by a shell containing up to 8 electrons.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Also orbital penetration.
        \item He recommends that we read the full paper: \textcite{bib:Lewis}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The easiest way to approach a new Lewis structure:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Draw a valid Lewis structure for a molecule.
        \item Place electron pairs in the valence shell as far away from each other as possible. Use the $\sigma$-bond framework first.
        \item Add $\pi$-bonds to complete the molecule.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Through the VSEPR approach, think of a molecule as arranged around a central atom $A$ by $m$ atoms or groups of atoms $X$ and $n$ lone electron pairs $E$.
    \item \textbf{Steric number}: The sum $n+m$ of groups and electron pairs around the central atom.
    \item Steric numbers correspond to geometries.
    \item VSEPR is ok but it doesn't capture reality too well.
    \item Consider trimethyl boron (\ce{BMe3}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trigonal planar ($D_{3h}$).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Octahedral: $O_h$.
    \item Bent: $C_{2v}$.
    \item \textbf{Order of the repulsive forces}: lone pair - lone pair $>$ lone pair - bonding pair $>$ bonding pair - bonding pair.
    \item In \ce{SF4} (see-saw), will the lone pair be axial or equatorial?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Equatorial --- $2\times\ang{120}$ and $2\times\ang{90}$ vs. $3\times\ang{90}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item In \ce{BrF3}\dots

    \begin{itemize}
        \item T-shaped --- $4\times\ang{90}$ vs. $6\times\ang{90}$ or lone pairs in cis-position.
    \end{itemize}
    \item In ions such as \ce{ICl4-}, we get square planar ($D_{4h}$).
    \item With mixed substituents (such as \ce{PF2Cl3})\dots

    \begin{itemize}
        \item We need \textbf{Bent's rule}, which tells us that atoms share electrons from $p$- or $d$-orbitals to a greater extent than they do from $s$-orbitals.
        \item Thus, when phosphorous excites $3s^23p^3$ to $3s^13p_x^13p_y^1ep_z^13d_{z^2}^2$ and then rehybridizes to create three $sp^2$ orbitals (each composed of $s+p_x+p_y$) and two "$pd$" hybrid orbitals (each composed of $p_z+d_{z^2}$), the equatorial $sp^2$ orbitals bond to the more \textbf{electropositive} chlorines and the axial "$pd$" hybrid orbitals bond to the remaining more electronegative fluorines.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bent's rule}: Atomic $s$-character concentrates in orbitals directed toward electropositive substituents.
    \item \textbf{Electropositive} (species): A species that has relatively lower electronegativity than another.
    \item For molecules with multiple bonds, ignore $\pi$-bonds.
    \item Linear: $D_{\infty h}$.
    \item Problems with VSEPR:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{XeF6} with 14 bonding electrons (7 pairs) is supposed to be pentagonal bipyramidal, but is actually octahedral (a known problem for \ce{14e-} systems).
        \item Heavy main group elements with no hybridization.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \ce{H-C#C-H} is linear, but \ce{H-Si#Si-H} is not.
            \item No $\sigma$-bond exists in the latter species --- it's all $\pi$-bonding interactions.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item You maybe don't have to watch the modules and textbook \emph{and} attend class.
\end{itemize}
